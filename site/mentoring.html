            <li><strong>Yi Liu</strong> (UCLA, Summer Programs for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) Funded undergraduate researcher â€™24-25): Characterizing the long-term trends in dust aerosol concentrations over East Asia using a combination of ground-based observations and modeling outputs. "Abstract: 
Dust aerosols play a critical role in radiative forcing, cloud microphysics, biogeochemical cycles, and air quality. Their interactions with regional climate processes in East Asia are particularly complex, necessitating a comprehensive approach to accurately assess their spatial and temporal variability. In this study, we combine multiple sources of observations collected over a twenty-year period (2005â€“2024) to provide a robust analysis of dust aerosol behavior. Ground-based measurementsâ€”including the Asian Dust and Aerosol Lidar Observation Network (AD-Net) and AERONETâ€”offer high-resolution insights into aerosol vertical profiles and optical properties. In addition, we compare these observational datasets with outputs from the CMIP6 models to evaluate the performance of current climate simulations regarding dust aerosol dynamics. Our integrated analysis reveals a statistically significant decline in dust aerosol optical depth over the period 2005â€“2014, observed consistently across both ground-based datasets and largely in agreement with the dust trends predicted by the CMIP6 models. Trend for a longer time period needs further investigation. This downward trend suggests modifications to the regional energy balance that could significantly affect cloud formation, precipitation patterns, and overall climate feedback mechanisms. The study underscores the importance of improving dust aerosol representations in climate models to enhance the accuracy of future projections and deepens our understanding of aerosolâ€“climate interactions in East Asia.

            <li><strong>Andy Wang</strong> (UCLA, JIFRESSE Summer Internship Program (JSIP) funded â€™23): Dust Aerosols from SAGE-III/ISS Observations. "Abstarct: Dust is the atmosphere's main source of ice nucleating particles, especially for cirrus clouds. The upper-tropospheric dust impact cirrus clouds heavily depends on the vertical distribution, size distribution, and concentration of dust aerosols. However, the vertical size distribution and concentration of upper-tropospheric dust are poorly constrained due to retrieval limitations of CALIOP when compared with in-site (ATom) observations. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to quantify the upper-tropospheric dust aerosol using the multi-year and multi-wavelength radio occultation observations from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE)-III instruments onboard the International Space Station (ISS), together with supporting satellite remote sensing (CALIPSO).
For this purpose, we conducted the following analysisâ€” (1) Identified major dust outbreaks over Africa, Middle East and Central Asia, and East Asia using NASA's A-train satellite observations during 2017-2021, when SAGE-III/ISS observations are available. (2) Over these dust-dominated regions, evaluated the SAGE-III/ISS observed aerosol extinction profiles at multiple wavelengths (384, 448, 520, 601, 676, 755, 869, 1022, and 1543 nm) to assess the dust's optical and microphysical properties. (3) assessed the spectral characteristics of upper-tropospheric aerosol layers as a function of multi-wavelength extinction ratio versus 1021 nm extinction following a similar approach as in (Knepp et al., 2021).
Overall, from this JSIP summer project, we expect that the initial results obtained from SAGE-III/ISS observations will help us to develop a retrieval algorithm to detect the upper tropospheric dust aerosol and associated size distribution and concentration and, finally, the evaluation of the interaction of upper-tropospheric dust and cirrus clouds."
